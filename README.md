# PlayAroundMe
This is a tool used while playing a limited game of Magic: the Gathering (MTG). 


During a game of MTG it is important to imagine what cards your opponent may have in their hand based on the current circumstance, and to the best of your ability, mitigate the negative effects of those cards. This tool helps determine cards they may be hiding!


Currently working for M19.


### How to use


1. Select all open mana sources your opponent has availiable. In this case, the opponent has two Islands untapped.

2. Click the "Play Around Me" button to see all possible instants, tricks, or flash creatures your opponent could possibly cast with their open mana!

Currently only works with one multi mana source. Still working on an efficient way to create a large number of permutations!
